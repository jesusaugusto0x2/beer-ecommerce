This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This was developed under node version `20.11.1`

## Getting Started

1.- Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2.- Then, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

3.- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

- The data exists under `/src/data`. There are the 2 files coming in the test description: `products.js` and `stock-price.js`, you can modify the last one to test the polling feature inside product details
- There's a deployed version of the project under [this link](https://beer-ecommerce-one.vercel.app/). Bad thing is you can't do the manual data update.
- Other than that, I really appreciate the opportunity to take the test. I hope you like it as much as I did! :)
